## 💫 About Me

I’m a software engineer focused on building **scalable, user-centric applications** across web and mobile platforms.

🔭 Currently building a **Smart Agriculture mobile application** designed to support modern farming workflows using real-time data and automation.  
🌱 Strong foundation in **Data Structures & Algorithms (C++)**, with consistent problem-solving practice.  
🧠 Experienced across **frontend, backend, databases, and UI/UX**, enabling true end-to-end product development.  
💬 Comfortable discussing system design, APIs, databases, and clean code practices.  

⚡ Outside of code, I enjoy dancing, humor, and exploring emerging tech stacks.
